I remembered somethings, but not everything

Trying to write a code by yourself, an example is defining the run_method.

The easiest part was reading the errors and knowing what  your code was about

I think it was because it was very simple code but it depends on how you arrange the algorithims and that frustrated a lot of people and made it harder to sole the probems. 

Yes, because it teaches you about the simplest things and the programming can both frustrating and easy, you just need a clear mind the right idea and the right time.

The difference between the instrutions and the algorithims are, the instructions were to get through and find the stairs, by walking, resting, attacking, and retreating. But the algorithims was what order is was going to be, either you attack first and then rest or you rest then attack and this made it hard.

Processing
Writing the code is very  easy and simple.
The hard part is writting the right code
I think we spent time on processing because it was fun and also instructive.
